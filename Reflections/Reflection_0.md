Our team formed around a mutual interest in operating systems, learning more about the intricacies of C, and network programming and design. We wanted a project that involved as many of these elements as possible, was compelling/interesting, and was modular in such a way that we could shrink or grow the project depending on what our team thought it could accomplish in the project period. We decided our scrum master through the process of determining who wanted it the most, which turned out to be very easy because only one member of the team expressed any marked interest in the role. At this stage in the process, there isn't quite enough concrete work for it to be divided among team members yet, so every member of the team was assigned the same reading so we could all be on the same page in terms of C/server understanding. The idea is to get the team prepared to accomplish tasks when we know enough to determine what those tasks are. As far as our sprint backlog goes, we haven't put much effort into specifics besides what the team needs to read for what date. The reason for leaving out specific action items is that we don't know what we would do for them, and we don't want to throw in vague things we think we'll need to do because they wouldn't be helpful. I'm apprehensive about how long it will take us to figure out what we actually need to do this project.
